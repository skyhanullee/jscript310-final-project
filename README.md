# JSCRIPT310 FINAL PROJECT: RECIPE SEARCH USING THEMEALDB

The app will take an input from the user and display results using the input.
I used JavaScript and jQuery for the backend and Bootstrap 4 for the frontend. I hope to implement AJAX to allow for smoother loading results.

## Assignment instructions:
The final project is very open-ended - this is a chance for you to put together the lessons of this course and turn it in to a cool mini-project.  This could be a game, a simple app or dashboard, or an interactive display.

Requirements:
1. Your project must be interactive (i.e. must have event listeners).  The user must be able to interact with the document with the mouse or keyboard and have the document change / update.
2. Your project must include 4 of the 6 following features (but may include more):
3. Have fun with it!

My project include these 4 of the 6 required features:
- [ ] One or more [Classes] (must use static methods and/or prototype methods)
- [ ] Write [testable code], use [Jasmine] unit tests
- [x] One or more [timing functions]
- [x] One or more [fetch requests] to a 3rd party [API]
- [x] Sets, updates, or changes [local storage]
- [x] Contains [form fields], [validates] those fields
