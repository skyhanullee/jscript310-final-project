The final project is very open-ended - this is a chance for you to put together the lessons of this course and turn it in to a cool mini-project.  This could be a game, a simple app or dashboard, or an interactive display.

Requirements:

1. Your project must be interactive (i.e. must have event listeners).  The user must be able to interact with the document with the mouse or keyboard and have the document change / update.

2. Your project must include 4 of the 6 following features (but may include more):

One or more Classes (must use static methods and/or prototype methods)
Write testable code, use Jasmine unit tests
One or more timing functions
One or more fetch requests to a 3rd party API
Sets, updates, or changes local storage
Contains form fields, validates those fields
3. Have fun with it!
